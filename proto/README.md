# Protocol definitions and generated bindings

This directory owns FlexModule v2 wire contracts and their generated Go gRPC
bindings. The runtime and modules use the wrappers in
[`../shared`](../shared/README.md); generated messages alone do not implement
authorization, sandbox bootstrap or lifecycle.

## Current sources

| Source | Contract |
|---|---|
| `core-v2/core.proto` | Backend-neutral manifest, requirements/actual grants, resource scopes, exact JSON configuration, Hook lifecycle/events, credential/file refs and streaming FileTransfer |
| `discord-v2/domain.proto` | Typed Discord snapshots, presence-aware partials, nullable/list/map wrappers and closed component variants |
| `discord-v2/events.proto` | Concrete safe event DTOs, packed into the core event envelope with a registered type URL |
| `discord-v2/helper.proto` | Canonical typed Discord helper operations; convenience aliases are SDK recipes, not extra RPCs |
| `discord-v2/ownership.proto` | Exact interaction-route ownership and provisioned credential-ref operations |
| `discord-v2/voice.proto` | Optional bounded voice playback/receive job service, separate from ordinary helpers |

There are no current `hooks.proto`/`helpers.proto` entry points or v1 compatibility
bindings. Application handshake/manifest major 2 must agree; runtime and modules
are rebuilt together. The authenticated primary Hook transport has one fixed,
lifetime-scoped reverse-helper connection, shared by the core/file/backend
services. Adding a backend does not add a broker connection.

The schemas do not serialize `discordgo.Session`, live `State`,
`VoiceConnection`, file readers or raw host credentials. File bytes use explicit
streaming refs. Interaction/webhook credentials use typed opaque references.
Absent, zero, false, empty, clear and explicit JSON null remain distinct; enum
and permission-mask values are not renumbered to declaration ordinals.

`StageRequest.init_context` supplies the authenticated `persistent_directory`
and `scratch_directory` paths. Consumers must use those values rather than
assuming literal mount locations; host implementation constants are not
replacement configuration.

## Regenerate Go bindings

From the repository root, with the pinned Go compiler installed:

```sh
make tools
make prepare-sdk
make buf
make buf-check
```

[`buf.gen.yaml`](buf.gen.yaml) uses the pinned local
`.tools/bin/protoc-gen-go` and `protoc-gen-go-grpc`, with
`paths=source_relative` and `require_unimplemented_servers=false`.
`make buf` runs Buf through `tools/generate.sh` into staging, validates the exact
owned output set from `Makefile`, then publishes transactionally. Failure before
publication preserves existing outputs; partial publication is rolled back.
`make buf-check` compares staged outputs without changing checked-in files.
Neither command recursively deletes unrelated `.pb.go` files.

Buf consumes the checked-in `.proto` sources. It does **not** refresh SDK source
inventories, emit schemas from source policy, regenerate domain conversions or
rebuild helper clients/backend planners.

## Maintain source-derived contracts

The root `go.mod` pins upstream `github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo`
`v0.29.1-0.20260214123928-f43dd94faaac` and replaces it with
`./.tools/deps/discordgo`; nested media modules use the matching requirement and
`../../.tools/deps/discordgo`. [`tools/sdk.py`](../tools/sdk.py) verifies the
upstream download against `third_party/discordgo/upstream.sum` and applies the
[four numbered DiscordGo patches](../third_party/discordgo/README.md) in lexical
filename order, without a `series` file. The root requirement is the version
authority; consumer `go.sum` files are not original-checksum authority because
`go mod tidy` prunes sums for the locally replaced module.

`make prepare-sdk` publishes immutable generations below `.tools/deps`, selected
by the stable relative alias `.tools/deps/discordgo`. Compilation and extraction
resolve the same prepared source; neither falls back to a fork checkout or
unpatched upstream. Provenance contains exactly `Path`, `Version`, `Sum`,
`GoModSum`, `PatchSHA256` and `SourceSHA256`, not machine-specific `Dir`.
Preparation takes an exclusive lock; compiler/native consumers of the stable
alias hold a shared lease and revalidate without writes as described in the
[root build instructions](../README.md#pinned-builds-and-independent-artifacts).
The extractor compiles using only the standard library, resolves an immutable
generation `Dir` and reads that generation directly. Do not wrap the extractor
or a preparing resolver in a shared lease: preparation takes the exclusive lock.

Reviewed inventories and policy are under `tools/protocol/inventory/`;
historical v0.29.0/v1 audits and published SDK v0.30.0 evidence remain provenance,
not current dependency instructions or the API ceiling. `Label`, `FileUpload`
and `MessageSnapshot` already belong to the pinned upstream, not the local patch
stack. Inventory labels such as `discordgo/restapi.go` are stable logical source
identities, not checkout paths. After an intentional SDK/source-policy change,
update reviewed policy and all six provenance fields rather than weakening
inventory checks.
The dependent generation order is:

```sh
make prepare-sdk
env -u GOROOT .tools/go/bin/go run -mod=readonly ./tools/protocol/extract-source.go \
  -sdk github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo -out tools/protocol/inventory/source-extracted.json
python3 tools/protocol/refresh-inventory.py
python3 tools/protocol/emit-domain.py
python3 tools/protocol/generate_events.py
python3 tools/protocol/generate-api.py
make buf
python3 tools/protocol/generate-conversions.py
python3 tools/protocol/generate-client.py
python3 tools/protocol/generate-backend-api.py
python3 tools/protocol/generate-backend-events.py
```

The Go command assumes the pinned distribution is installed at
`.tools/go/bin/go`; use the actual pinned compiler path if you chose another
installation. Run these commands from the repository root and prepare before
direct Go execution. Review all generated source/mapping changes together;
this sequence is not a replacement for formatting, build, test, external
consumer or live acceptance work.

The `-sdk` flag may be omitted for the same upstream import-path default; a local
directory is not an accepted argument. Backend generation publishes
`api_generated.go`, `json_codec_generated.go`, `api_projection_generated.go`
and `rest_plans_generated.go` under `internal/backend/discord`, and coverage to
`tools/protocol/backend-api-coverage.json` by default. To stage all five outputs
without publishing them into the checkout:

```sh
python3 tools/protocol/generate-backend-api.py --output-dir /absolute/staging/directory
```

The staging directory receives the four Go files and `backend-api-coverage.json`;
review them together before intentional publication. This staging option does
not run Buf, formatters, builds or tests.

| Generator | Owned inputs/outputs |
|---|---|
| `extract-source.go`, `refresh-inventory.py` | Current SDK declarations plus reviewed source policy to refreshed API/event/type inventories; historical audits are not overwritten |
| `emit-domain.py` | Domain schema and `domain-mapping.json` from the reviewed type inventory |
| `generate_events.py` | Event schema, typed event registry and `event-mapping.json` |
| `generate-api.py` | Helper schema, operation registry and `api-mapping.json` |
| `generate-conversions.py` | Safe views, conversions, ingress/projection support and conversion coverage from mappings and generated message shapes |
| `generate-client.py` | Typed SDK calls, explicit aliases and client coverage using the canonical API mapping and safe converter types |
| `generate-backend-api.py` | Host helper handlers, fixed REST plans/codecs/projections and source-derived planning fixtures/coverage |
| `generate-backend-events.py` | Host typed Gateway event projection under `internal/backend/discord/events_generated.go`, from the reviewed event mapping |

`core.proto`, `ownership.proto` and `voice.proto` remain explicit contracts;
source inventory generation does not infer grants or redefine those services.
Mapping/coverage JSON describes reviewed source decisions and generated scope,
not proof that runtime authorization, Docker isolation, Discord mutations or
encrypted voice passed. See the root [P0-P6 links and validation
boundaries](../README.md#generic-modules-scopes-and-validation-boundaries).
